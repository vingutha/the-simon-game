# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a digital adaptation of the iconic Simon electronic game, designed as part of a programming course like Udemy. It challenges players to replicate an increasingly complex sequence of lights and sounds.

Built using fundamental web technologies, this project employs:
- **HTML** for structuring content,
- **CSS** for styling, and
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and functionality.

## Key Features
- **Game Logic:** JavaScript manages sequence generation, player input, and level progression.
- **User Interface:** HTML/CSS creates an intuitive, visually appealing circular layout.
- **Audio Integration:** Provides feedback for player actions with corresponding sounds.
- **Scoring and Levels:** Dynamically adjusts difficulty based on player progress.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures compatibility across devices.

The project offers a practical exercise for developers, reinforcing JavaScript interactivity, DOM manipulation, and game development fundamentals. It's both a recreation of a classic game and a hands-on opportunity to apply skills in a fun context.
